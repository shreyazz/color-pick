# Color-Pick


This is my first mini-project using [React.JS](https://reactjs.org/), in this project I have made a random color generator. 

Try it : https://pick-color-shreyazz.vercel.app/

### How to use it?

- Click on the hex code to change the color.

- Click on the copy icon to copy the hex code.

   

### What did I learn from this project?

- React Components.
- React Hooks.
- How to import functions in react.
- Copy to Clipboard feature.



### Next Updates :

- I am going to add a back button so that the user could navigate to the previous color. 
- Improving the code quality.
- I have made an API for fetching the colors, so instead to importing it locally, I'll fetch it from [my own API.](https://color-api.shreyazz.repl.co/colors)
